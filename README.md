# Doggy DNA Analyzer

## Overview

This R script demonstrates advanced statistical analysis applied to a fun real-world problem: determining which family member best guessed our mixed-breed puppy's DNA test results. The code showcases robust data manipulation, statistical comparison of probability distributions, and data visualization techniques to analyze and rank family members' predictions against actual DNA test results.

## Key Features

- **Statistical Distribution Analysis**: Implements multiple comparison metrics including Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and Euclidean distance to quantitatively evaluate prediction accuracy
  
- **Distribution Comparison**: Creates a reusable function for comparing probability distributions with proper statistical testing and error handling

- **Visualization Design**: Creates intuitive visualizations that effectively communicate comparative results

- **Advanced R Programming**: Leverages modern R packages including dplyr, purrr, ggplot2, and janitor

- **Reproducible Research**: Thoroughly commented code making the analysis transparent and reproducible

- **Statistical Knowledge**: Applies information theory concepts and statistical tests to quantify differences between distributions

## Usage

The code works with a simple data table of breed percentages (from DNA testing) and family members' guesses. It can be easily adapted to similar comparison problems by modifying the input data structure.
